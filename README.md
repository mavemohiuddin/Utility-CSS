## **About this Project:**

This repository offers a lightweight, Tailwind-inspired CSS template (style.css) designed for rapid project setup and easy customization. The stylesheet features a collection of essential utility classes and base styles, following a consistent, expandable pattern for maintainability and scalability.

### **Key Features:**
